# cfunctional - A functional Approach to C
Tests on creating a small functional C library

To test this you obviously need a c compiler instlalled. I have tested with GCC

Run:
```sh
$ make
```

Run test:

```sh
$ ./test
```

Example output:
```sh
1.00
2.00
2.00

-1.00
-2.00
-2.00

1.00, 2.00, 2.00, 

2.25
6.25
6.25

all tests run
```
